# IT-Ticket-Analysis---Spreadsheet-Project
I analyzed IT support ticket data using Microsoft Excel to identify trends and bottlenecks, leveraging Pivot Tables, charts, and conditional formatting to summarize ticket categories and resolution times. I also built a dynamic dashboard to highlight key KPIs such as ticket volume, resolution time, and issue types, providing actionable insights that helped improve IT support performance and optimize resource allocation.
